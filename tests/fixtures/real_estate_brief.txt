STORIES & EXAMPLES
------------------
Story 1: Last month I helped a young couple buy their first home in Bellevue—they were competing against 8 other offers. We structured an escalation clause with a personal letter to the sellers about their growing family, and we won at just $5k over asking (vs the $50k+ others were offering blind). They saved $45k by having the right strategy.

Story 2: I sold a luxury waterfront property in Medina for $3.2M—15% over asking—by staging it like a boutique hotel and hosting exclusive "by appointment only" showings. We had 12 offers in 4 days.

Story 3: A client was about to walk away from their dream home because the inspection found $30k in foundation issues. I negotiated with the seller to cover repairs AND knocked $15k off the price. Client got their dream home and $45k in value.

TOPICS & THEMES
--------------
Topic 1: First-time buyer mistakes to avoid (pre-approval, inspection, escalation clauses)
Topic 2: Staging and presentation strategies that get top dollar
Topic 3: Seattle/Bellevue/Medina market trends and neighborhood spotlights
Topic 4: Behind-the-scenes of the buying/selling process
Topic 5: How to win in competitive markets without overpaying

DATA USAGE PREFERENCES
---------------------
Stories: Use all three stories above—they showcase different aspects of my expertise
Stats: Seattle median home price ($850k), average days on market (18 days), percentage of homes going over asking (62%)
Client Data: Client names can be anonymized ("a client" or "a couple"), but dollar amounts and neighborhoods are real and okay to share

CALL TO ACTION PREFERENCES
---------------------------
Preferred CTAs:
- "Thinking of buying or selling? DM me to chat"
- "Drop a 🏡 if you're house hunting this year"
- "What's your biggest question about the Seattle market? Reply below"
- "Ready to make a move? Link in bio to schedule a free consultation"

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
------------------
I've been in real estate for 8 years, closed over $47M in transactions, and I'm a consistent top 5% producer in my brokerage. I'm also a mom of two, so I understand the family side of home buying. My content should reflect expertise but also relatability.

Avoid: Anything that sounds too "salesy" or pushy. No fear-mongering about the market. No legal/financial advice (just general guidance).

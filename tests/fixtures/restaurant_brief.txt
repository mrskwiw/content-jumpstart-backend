CLIENT DISCOVERY BRIEF: Osteria Luna

BUSINESS INFORMATION
--------------------
Company Name: Osteria Luna
Business Description: Family-owned Italian restaurant featuring farm-to-table cuisine with ingredients sourced from local Pacific Northwest farms. We specialize in handmade pasta, wood-fired pizza, and seasonal menus that change based on what's fresh. Cozy 45-seat dining room with an open kitchen so guests can watch our chefs work.

AUDIENCE & POSITIONING
---------------------
Ideal Customer: Food lovers and families looking for authentic Italian dining experience, date night couples wanting a special-but-not-stuffy atmosphere, and locals who care about where their food comes from

Main Problem Solved: Finding a restaurant that feels authentic and special without being pretentious or overpriced. A place where you can bring your kids OR celebrate your anniversary.

Unique Approach: We're not trying to be a fancy downtown Italian restaurant. We're a neighborhood spot that happens to serve restaurant-quality food. Our chef (my brother Marco) trained in Rome but cooks like Nonna—simple, seasonal, and from the heart. Everything is made from scratch daily, including our pasta, bread, and desserts.

STORIES & EXAMPLES
------------------
Story 1: Last Tuesday we got a delivery of the first porcini mushrooms of the season from a forager in the Cascades. Chef Marco literally ran out to the dining room to show guests—we added a special that night (pappardelle with porcini, brown butter, and sage) and it sold out in 2 hours. We had people calling for reservations just for that dish.

Story 2: A couple came in for their first date 3 years ago, got engaged at our chef's table last year, and just had their rehearsal dinner with us last month. The bride asked us to recreate the exact meal from their first date (cacio e pepe and tiramisu). Marco and I both cried a little.

Story 3: During the pandemic, we started "Family Meal Kits" with pre-portioned ingredients and video instructions so families could cook our dishes at home. It kept us afloat when dining rooms were closed, and customers told us it became their weekly tradition. We still offer them every Sunday even though we're back to full capacity—it's become part of who we are.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
------------------
My brother Marco (head chef) and I (owner/front of house) opened Osteria Luna 5 years ago. We grew up in our family's restaurant in New Jersey, and this is our dream come true. We're not trying to be the next Michelin star—we want to be the place our neighborhood can't imagine living without.

We've been featured in Seattle Magazine's "Best Neighborhood Italian" and have a 4.8 star rating on Google with 400+ reviews. Our most popular dishes are the cacio e pepe, margherita pizza with San Marzano tomatoes, and Marco's Nonna's tiramisu recipe.

Avoid: Anything too formal or corporate. We're not a "brand," we're a family business. Don't oversell or use food influencer buzzwords ("elevated", "curated", "artisanal everything").  Keep it real and delicious.

CLIENT DISCOVERY BRIEF: Ocean Guardians Alliance

BUSINESS INFORMATION
--------------------
Company Name: Ocean Guardians Alliance
Business Description: Environmental nonprofit dedicated to ocean conservation and marine life protection in the Pacific Northwest. We focus on three areas: beach cleanup initiatives, marine wildlife rescue and rehabilitation, and ocean literacy education programs for schools and communities. 501(c)(3) organization founded in 2016.

AUDIENCE & POSITIONING
---------------------
Ideal Customer: Environmentally conscious donors, volunteers passionate about marine conservation, educators looking for ocean science programs, families who want to get involved in hands-on conservation, and corporate partners seeking meaningful CSR partnerships

Main Problem Solved: Empowering people to take action against ocean pollution and climate impacts on marine ecosystems. Making conservation accessible and showing that individual actions collectively create massive impact.

Unique Approach: We're boots-on-the-ground conservationists, not just a donation box. 85 cents of every dollar goes directly to programs (not overhead). Volunteers get to see their impact immediately—whether it's releasing a rehabilitated seal, removing 500 lbs of trash from a beach, or teaching kids about tide pools. We believe in joy-filled activism, not guilt-based fundraising.

CONTENT STRATEGY
---------------
Primary Platform: Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram
Posting Frequency: 3-4 times per week
Content Goals: Inspire action (donations, volunteering, behavior change), showcase impact, educate about ocean conservation, build community among supporters

BRAND VOICE
-----------
Tone & Personality: Hopeful, passionate, action-oriented, educational without being preachy
Voice Description: We speak with urgency but not despair. We celebrate wins while acknowledging challenges. We're the friend who gets you excited about conservation, not the doomscroller who makes you feel hopeless. Science-based but accessible—we explain the "why" behind our work.

Key Phrases We Use:
- "Every action creates ripples"
- "Protecting our ocean, one wave at a time"
- "Small acts, massive impact"
- "Be the change the ocean needs"
- "Together, we are unstoppable"

STORIES & EXAMPLES
------------------
Story 1: Last summer, volunteers removed 12,000 pounds of trash from 8 beaches during our Summer Cleanup Series. Among the items: 2,347 plastic bottles, 1,892 cigarette butts, 487 fishing nets, and one entire couch (!). But here's the most powerful part—18 volunteers told us it was their first-ever beach cleanup. They've since become monthly volunteers. That's how movements grow.

Story 2: In March, our marine rescue team got a call about a young harbor seal tangled in fishing line with severe wounds. After 6 weeks of round-the-clock care, antibiotics, and rehabilitation, we released "Hope" (as volunteers named her) back into Puget Sound. Over 200 people showed up for the release, and 47 of them signed up to volunteer or donate that day. Hope's story raised $23,000 for our rescue program.

Story 3: We partnered with 12 schools in underserved communities to bring ocean science programs to 850 students who had never seen the ocean despite living 30 minutes from it. We took them on field trips to tide pools and our research center. One 4th grader told her teacher, "I didn't know there were scientists who look like me. I want to be a marine biologist now." That's why education matters.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
------------------
Our founder and executive director, Jamie Chen, is a marine biologist who spent 10 years in research before realizing she wanted to focus on conservation action and community engagement. Our team includes 4 full-time staff, 12 part-time educators and marine rescue specialists, and over 2,100 volunteers.

We're funded by individual donations (60%), foundation grants (25%), corporate partnerships (10%), and earned revenue from education programs (5%). Our annual budget is $1.2M. We're transparent about finances—our Form 990 is public on our website.

Major supporters include the Pacific Northwest Foundation, REI, and Patagonia. We've been featured in Seattle Times, National Geographic's "Ocean Heroes" series, and won the 2023 Governor's Environmental Excellence Award.

Avoid: Guilt-based fundraising, doom-and-gloom messaging, images of suffering animals without context/hope, corporate greenwashing language, talking down to people who are just learning about ocean issues. We lead with hope and empowerment, not shame.

Visual Content Note: We have tons of great photos and videos—beach cleanups, wildlife releases, kids learning at tide pools, underwater footage. Content should be visually rich and uplifting whenever possible.

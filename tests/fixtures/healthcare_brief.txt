CLIENT DISCOVERY BRIEF: Cascade Family Dentistry

BUSINESS INFORMATION
--------------------
Company Name: Cascade Family Dentistry
Business Description: Modern family dental practice offering general dentistry, cosmetic procedures, and pediatric care. We focus on preventive care and patient education in a comfortable, anxiety-free environment. State-of-the-art technology including digital x-rays, same-day crowns, and sedation dentistry for anxious patients.

AUDIENCE & POSITIONING
---------------------
Ideal Customer: Families seeking a "dental home" for all ages, adults who haven't been to the dentist in years due to anxiety or bad past experiences, and professionals wanting cosmetic improvements (whitening, veneers)

Main Problem Solved: Making dental care less scary and more accessible. Helping people overcome dental anxiety and understand why oral health matters for overall health. Making it easy for busy families to get everyone's dental care in one place.

Unique Approach: We're not a corporate dental chain. Dr. Kim sees every patient personally, remembers your kids' names, and takes time to explain everything before we do it. We offer evening and Saturday appointments for working families. Our office feels like a modern spa, not a medical clinic—and we have Netflix and noise-canceling headphones for anxious patients.

CONTENT STRATEGY
---------------
Primary Platform: Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube
Posting Frequency: 3-4 times per week
Content Goals: Educate patients on oral health, bust dental myths, showcase patient success stories (with permission), reduce fear and anxiety about dental visits

BRAND VOICE
-----------
Tone & Personality: Friendly, educational, empathetic, professional but approachable
Voice Description: We talk like a trusted healthcare provider who's also your neighbor. Empathetic to dental anxiety, never judgmental. We explain things clearly without medical jargon. Evidence-based but not academic or boring.

Key Phrases We Use:
- "Your smile is our priority"
- "Gentle care for the whole family"
- "No judgment, just great dental care"
- "Prevention is the best medicine"
- "We make dental visits something to smile about"
- "Healthy smiles start here"

STORIES & EXAMPLES
------------------
Story 1: A patient came to us who hadn't been to the dentist in 12 years due to severe anxiety from childhood dental trauma. We started with just a consultation—no tools, no treatment, just talking. Over 6 months, we gradually rebuilt trust. Now she comes every 6 months for cleanings and recently told me, "I never thought I'd say this, but I don't dread coming to the dentist anymore." That's why I do this work.

Story 2: We had a teenage patient who was being bullied about his crooked teeth. His family couldn't afford traditional braces, so we worked out a payment plan for Invisalign. 14 months later, his mom sent me a photo of him smiling at prom—full teeth-showing grin. She said it was the first time she'd seen him smile like that in 3 years.

Story 3: A 58-year-old executive came in wanting to improve his smile before his daughter's wedding. We did a combination of whitening and porcelain veneers on his front teeth. At his final appointment, he teared up looking in the mirror and said, "I look like myself again—the version I remember from 20 years ago." He's referred 6 friends since then.

TOPICS & THEMES
--------------
Topic 1: Oral health myths (Do you really need to floss? Is teeth whitening safe? etc.)
Topic 2: Connection between oral health and overall health (heart disease, diabetes, etc.)
Topic 3: How to help kids develop good dental habits
Topic 4: What to expect during common procedures (root canals, crowns, cleanings)
Topic 5: Overcoming dental anxiety and fear

DATA USAGE PREFERENCES
---------------------
Stories: All three stories can be used—patient details are anonymized but scenarios are real
Stats: 90% of our patients report low/no anxiety after their first visit with us, we've treated 3 generations of families, 47% of new patients are referrals from existing patients
Clinical Data: Evidence-based health info is great (e.g., "Studies show people with gum disease are 2x more likely to have heart disease"), but always cite sources and use approachable language

CALL TO ACTION PREFERENCES
---------------------------
Preferred CTAs:
- "When's the last time you had a checkup? Schedule yours today—link in bio"
- "Questions about this? Drop them in the comments"
- "Share this with someone who needs to hear it"
- "Ready to smile with confidence? Call us at [phone] or book online"
- "Tag someone who's been putting off the dentist"

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
------------------
Dr. Sarah Kim (that's me) has been practicing dentistry for 15 years. I opened Cascade Family Dentistry 7 years ago after working in corporate dentistry and realizing I wanted to practice medicine the way I believed it should be done—relationship-based, patient-centered, and focused on prevention.

We accept most major insurance plans and offer flexible payment options for procedures not covered. Our team includes 2 dental hygienists, a pediatric specialist who comes in twice a month, and our office manager Lisa who patients say is the most welcoming person they've ever met at a medical office.

Avoid: Anything that sounds like we're selling unnecessary procedures or fear-mongering. We never want to shame people for neglecting their dental health—we want to encourage them to come back. Also avoid overly clinical language or graphic images (we want to reduce anxiety, not increase it).

HIPAA Compliance Note: Never use specific patient names, photos, or identifying details without written consent. Keep all clinical information general and educational.

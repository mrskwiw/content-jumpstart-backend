## 15 High-Performing Post Structures (Customize Each Per Client)

**HOW TO USE THIS:**
- Each template shows the structure + placeholder
- Replace [BRACKETS] with client-specific info
- Mix and match 2 posts per template (30 posts = variety)
- Vary opening hooks to keep audience engaged

---

## TEMPLATE 1: The Problem-Recognition Post
**Best for:** Building awareness, getting engagement  
**Format:** Hook problem → Validate feeling → Hint at solution

```
[HOOK - Label the problem in a way they haven't heard it]:
"Most [AUDIENCE TYPE] waste 60% of their time on [SPECIFIC TASK]."

[VALIDATE - Show you get their frustration]:
The worst part? They don't even realize it's happening.
Most assume [WRONG BELIEF] when really the issue is [ROOT CAUSE].

[REFRAME - Show the opportunity]:
Here's what changes when you shift that mindset...
[SPECIFIC EXAMPLE or small insight]

[CTA - Ask for engagement]:
Does this ring true for you? 
Reply with [SPECIFIC QUESTION] — I'm reading every comment.
```

**Example:**
```
Most agencies waste 40% of their budget hiring contractors through generic marketplaces.

The worst part? They don't even realize it's happening. They assume contractors are just inconsistent when really the issue is: no vetting system.

Here's what changes when you build a simple intake process... [2-3 lines of specific how-to]

Does this ring true? Reply with: "How do you vet right now?" — I'm reading every comment.
```

---

## TEMPLATE 2: The Statistic + Insight Post
**Best for:** Credibility, thought leadership  
**Format:** Stat → What it means → Unexpected angle

```
[STAT - Start with a surprising number]:
[STAT]% of [AUDIENCE] report [PROBLEM].
(Source: [publication])

[INTERPRETATION - What most people think]:
Most assume this means [COMMON BELIEF].

[FLIP - What it ACTUALLY means]:
But I think it signals something else:
[DEEPER INSIGHT - why the stat matters]

[REAL-WORLD APPLICATION]:
We saw this firsthand when [CASE EXAMPLE — brief, 1-2 sentences]
Result: [OUTCOME]

[CTA]:
Have you noticed this pattern?
```

**Example:**
```
73% of freelance hiring managers say contractor quality varies wildly.
(Source: HubSpot 2024)

Most assume this means the contractor pool is just inconsistent.

But I think it signals something else:
There's no systematic way to evaluate before hiring. So companies luck into good hires or learn the hard way.

We saw this firsthand when a client moved from random Upwork hires to a 3-question intake process.
Result: 90% of their contractors were usable vs 30% before.

Have you noticed this pattern?
```

## TEMPLATE 3: The "Against the Grain" Contrarian Take
**Best for:** Differentiation, starting conversations  
**Format:** Challenge conventional wisdom → Show why → Give nuance

```
[CONTRARIAN HEADLINE]:
"Everyone says [COMMON ADVICE], but [YOU DISAGREE]."

[SETUP - Acknowledge the conventional wisdom]:
Look, [COMMON ADVICE] is popular for a reason.
It works in [SPECIFIC SCENARIO].

[BUT - Where it breaks down]:
But here's what breaks: [SPECIFIC SITUATION where it fails]

[YOUR ANGLE]:
What actually works instead is [YOUR METHOD].
Here's why: [2-3 sentence explanation]

[CAVEAT - Show you're not extreme]:
(Of course, context matters. [EXCEPTION], and then [COMMON ADVICE] works fine.)

[CLOSING]:
The key is recognizing [KEY INSIGHT] rather than blindly following the rule.
```

**Example:**
```
Everyone says you should hire from the same contractor pool to build team consistency.

Look, building continuity is popular for a reason. It works if you're hiring for long-term roles.

But here's what breaks: Most SMBs don't have year-long projects. They need flexibility. And "consistent" contractors that don't fit one project are useless on the next.

What actually works instead is: Build a repeatable intake process instead of betting on the same people.
Here's why: A good process finds great people for each unique project.

(Of course context matters. If you're building a 2-year product roadmap, hiring the same team makes sense. But for project-based work, it's a trap.)

The key is recognizing that consistency in process beats consistency in people.
```

## TEMPLATE 4: The "Here's What Changed" Post
**Best for:** Authority, sharing lessons  
**Format:** Old way → What changed → New results

```
[CONTEXT - What we used to do]:
For years, we handled [PROCESS] like this:
[OLD METHOD — brief description]

[TRIGGER - What made us change]:
Then [EVENT/REALIZATION] forced us to try something different.

[NEW APPROACH]:
Now we [NEW METHOD].

[COMPARISON - Old vs New]:
Old way: [OUTCOME/PAIN]
New way: [OUTCOME/BENEFIT]

[WHAT WE LEARNED]:
The difference is [KEY INSIGHT]

[INVITATION]:
Are you still doing it the old way? Reply with [QUESTION] if you want to explore the new approach.
```

**Example:**
```
For years, we handled contractor onboarding like this:
Email them a bunch of docs, set a calendar call, hope they showed up prepared.

Then we noticed 40% of first calls were a waste because people hadn't even read the materials.

Now we use a simple 3-question intake form before confirming the call.

Old way: 40% of calls wasted, lots of ramp-up time
New way: 90% of calls productive from minute 1

The difference is that the intake form is a filter AND a teaching tool. Contractors know what to expect.

Are you still sending PDFs and hoping? Reply with "intake form" if you want to see what ours looks like.
```

## TEMPLATE 5: The Question Post (Engagement Magnet)
**Best for:** Driving comments, visibility  
**Format:** Open-ended question → Why it matters → Bonus insight

```
[QUESTION]:
[SPECIFIC, SURPRISING QUESTION]

[CONTEXT - Why I'm asking]:
I've been thinking about this because [BRIEF CONTEXT].

[BONUS - Offer your take first]:
My answer? [YOUR PERSPECTIVE]
But I'm genuinely curious what you think, because [REASON WHY IT MATTERS]

[INVITATION]:
Drop your answer in the comments. (I'm replying to all.)

[OPTIONAL SWEETENER]:
The most interesting response gets [SMALL VALUE — shout-out, resource, etc.]
```

**Example:**
```
When you're hiring a contractor, what matters more: a perfect resume or proof they can ship in your specific context?

I've been thinking about this because we just realized half our best contractors have "unconventional" backgrounds.

My answer? Proof they can ship in YOUR context wins every time.
A great designer might be terrible for your specific workflow. And a "less experienced" person who gets your systems might outperform them.

But I'm genuinely curious what you think, because I think we over-index on credentials.

Drop your answer in the comments. (I'm replying to all.)

The most thoughtful response gets a personalized hiring template from us.
```

## TEMPLATE 6: The Personal Story Post
**Best for:** Connection, vulnerability, being human  
**Format:** Setup → Crisis/realization → Lesson → Application

```
[SETUP - Relatable scenario]:
I once [SPECIFIC SITUATION most of your audience has experienced]

[CRISIS/REALIZATION]:
And then [THING THAT WENT WRONG] and I realized [WHAT I'D BEEN DOING WRONG]

[THE FEELING]:
In that moment, I felt [EMOTION] because [WHY IT MATTERED].

[LESSON]:
Looking back, the issue was [ROOT CAUSE/LESSON].

[APPLICATION]:
Now when [SIMILAR SITUATION ARISES], I [NEW APPROACH].

[RELEVANCE TO YOUR AUDIENCE]:
If you're [TARGET AUDIENCE SITUATION], you probably recognize this.
The fix is [ACTIONABLE INSIGHT]
```

**Example:**
```
I once hired a "senior contractor" for what I thought was a straightforward project.

And then after 2 weeks, they ghosted mid-delivery. I realized I'd never actually confirmed: Do they have capacity? What's their communication style? Have they done this specific type of work before?

In that moment, I felt embarrassed because I'd let my belief that "experience = reliability" cloud my judgment.

Looking back, the issue was: I hired based on credentials, not fit.

Now when I'm bringing someone on, I use a simple 3-question intake process that tells me more than their portfolio ever could.

If you're scaling via contractors, you probably recognize this. You hire someone who looks great on paper and they disappear or deliver mediocre work.

The fix is: Replace "credential checking" with a 15-min conversation about their actual capacity and workflow.
```

## TEMPLATE 7: The Myth-Busting Post
**Best for:** Authority, correctness, education  
**Format:** Common belief → Why it's wrong → Truth → Evidence

```
[MYTH]:
Myth: "[COMMON BELIEF about your industry/niche]"

[SEEMS TRUE BECAUSE]:
This seems true because [WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT]

[THE REALITY]:
But actually: [TRUTH]

[WHY IT MATTERS]:
This changes everything because [IMPACT]

[EVIDENCE/EXAMPLE]:
We tested this when [BRIEF EXAMPLE] and found [RESULT]

[WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD]:
Instead of [MYTH], try [BETTER APPROACH]
```

**Example:**
```
Myth: "You need to hire contractors with 10+ years experience for quality output."

This seems true because senior contractors are expensive, and expensive = good.

But actually: Experience matters less than fit. A contractor with 3 years of experience in YOUR specific context will outperform a 10-year generalist every time.

This changes everything because it opens your hiring pool to people you might otherwise overlook—and often at 40% lower cost.

We tested this when we compared experienced-but-generalist hires vs less-experienced-but-specialist hires. The specialists won on quality and delivery time.

Instead of filtering by years alone, try using a skill-specific project to evaluate capability. You'll find people traditional hiring processes miss.
```

## TEMPLATE 8: The "Things I Got Wrong" Post
**Best for:** Credibility, anti-hype, vulnerability  
**Format:** Belief → Why I was wrong → What I learned

```
[BELIEF I HELD]:
I used to believe: "[SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT WAS TRUE]"

[HOW LONG]:
I held this belief for [TIMEFRAME] because [WHY IT SEEMED TRUE]

[THE BREAK]:
Then [SPECIFIC MOMENT/DATA] proved me wrong.

[WHAT'S TRUE INSTEAD]:
The reality is [NEW UNDERSTANDING]

[HOW IT CHANGED WHAT I DO]:
Now [BEHAVIOR CHANGE]

[IMPLICATION FOR YOUR AUDIENCE]:
If you believe this too, the shift is [ACTIONABLE CHANGE]
```

**Example:**
```
I used to believe: "Longer contractor relationships = better output"

I held this for 5 years because everything felt more efficient with familiar faces.

Then I reviewed our actual performance data and realized: Our best projects had mixed teams. Our worst had pure continuity hires.

The reality is: Quality comes from the right mix for THIS specific project, not from knowing each other.

Now I actively rotate teams based on project needs, not on who's worked with us before.

If you believe longer relationships = better work, the shift is: Evaluate each project independently. You might find that fresh perspectives actually improve things.
```

## TEMPLATE 9: The Actionable How-To Post (Short Version)
**Best for:** Value, shareability, bookmarking  
**Format:** Problem → 3-4 quick steps → Result

```
[PROBLEM]:
Most [AUDIENCE] struggle with [SPECIFIC PROBLEM]

[QUICK FIX]:
Here's a 3-step process that takes 15 minutes:

1. [STEP]: [Explanation in 1-2 sentences]
   
2. [STEP]: [Explanation in 1-2 sentences]

3. [STEP]: [Explanation in 1-2 sentences]

[RESULT]:
After these steps: [OUTCOME]

[OPTIONAL]: "[I made a template for this — link in my bio if you want it]"

[CTA]:
Which step are you going to try first?
```

**Example:**
```
Most agencies struggle with inconsistent contractor deliverables.

Here's a 3-step process that takes 15 minutes and fixes it:

1. Create a "Definition of Done" doc
   List exactly what success looks like for THIS project (format, quality level, timeline). Share before work starts.

2. Use a pre-delivery checklist
   Have contractors confirm they've hit your standards before submitting. Catches issues early.

3. Give feedback within 24 hours
   Clear feedback loop = contractors know what to fix immediately.

After these steps: 70% fewer revision rounds, faster delivery, happier contractors.

I made a template for this — link in my bio if you want it.

Which step are you going to try first?

## TEMPLATE 10: The Comparison Post
**Best for:** Differentiation, decision-making  
**Format:** Two options → Trade-offs → Guidance

```
[SETUP]:
When [DECISION POINT], most people choose between [OPTION A] and [OPTION B].

[OPTION A - Pros/Cons]:
Option A: [OPTION A]
✓ [Advantage]
✓ [Advantage]
✗ [Disadvantage]

[OPTION B - Pros/Cons]:
Option B: [OPTION B]
✓ [Advantage]
✓ [Advantage]
✗ [Disadvantage]

[GUIDANCE - When to choose which]:
Choose A if [SPECIFIC CONTEXT/PERSON]
Choose B if [SPECIFIC CONTEXT/PERSON]

[NUANCE]:
The real question isn't A vs B. It's [DEEPER INSIGHT about what actually matters]

[CTA]:
Which camp are you in?
```

**Example:**
```
When hiring contractors, most people choose between: Marketplace platforms vs. direct referrals.

Marketplace (Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal):
✓ Huge pool to choose from
✓ Easy to hire and fire
✗ Quality is unpredictable

Direct referrals:
✓ Pre-vetted, trusted
✓ Usually better quality
✗ Limited options, can take months to find someone

Choose marketplaces if: You have a repeatable intake process and you're willing to try 5 people to find 1 good one.
Choose referrals if: You have time and you'd rather move slower for higher confidence.

The real question isn't marketplace vs. referrals. It's: Do you have a system to evaluate people quickly, or not?

Which camp are you in?
```

## TEMPLATE 11: The "What I Learned From..." Post
**Best for:** Connecting to culture/events, showing learning  
**Format:** Trigger → Key insight → Application

```
[TRIGGER]:
Reading [BOOK/ARTICLE/LISTENING TO PODCAST] by [PERSON], I found this line:
"[QUOTE]"

[WHY IT HIT]:
This stuck because [WHY IT RESONATED]

[INTERPRETATION]:
What that means in the context of [YOUR INDUSTRY/NICHE]:
[YOUR SPECIFIC TAKE]

[IMPLICATION]:
If that's true, then [BUSINESS INSIGHT for your audience]

[QUESTION]:
What's a belief you used to hold that you've completely flipped on?
```

**Example:**
```
Reading "A Matter of Trust" in HBR, I found this line:
"Trust is built in small, consistent actions, not grand gestures."

This stuck because I was trying to impress contractors with "perks" when really they wanted reliability.

What that means in the context of contractor management:
When you're consistent (same communication style, predictable feedback, reliable pay), contractors stick around. Fancy benefits don't matter if the fundamentals aren't solid.

If that's true, then: Invest in systems first, perks second.

What's a belief you used to hold that you've completely flipped on?
```

---

## TEMPLATE 12: The "Inside Look" Post
**Best for:** Transparency, behind-the-scenes, trust  
**Format:** Peek behind the curtain → Why we do it → Result

```
[TEASER]:
Here's something most people don't see about [PROCESS/DECISION]:

[INSIDE LOOK]:
When [PROCESS HAPPENS], we [YOUR SPECIFIC APPROACH].

Most people [ASSUME/DO THIS DIFFERENTLY], but we [DIFFERENT APPROACH].

[WHY]:
We made this choice because [REASONING].
The result: [OUTCOME]

[VULNERABILITY]:
It's not perfect — [LIMITATION or trade-off].
But it's better than [ALTERNATIVE]

[RELEVANCE]:
If you're [AUDIENCE SITUATION], the thing to test is [ACTIONABLE]
```

**Example:**
```
Here's something most people don't see about how we onboard contractors:

When someone applies to work with us, we immediately send them a 3-question intake form, not a calendar link.

Most people jump straight to a call, but we [Screen before investing time together].

We made this choice because we were wasting 40% of call time on context-setting.
The result: 90% of interviews are productive from minute 1.

It's not perfect — Some people get annoyed by the form and never respond.
But it's better than discovering mid-call that someone isn't a fit.

If you're scaling hiring, the thing to test is: Filter before meeting.
```

## TEMPLATE 13: The Future-Thinking Post
**Best for:** Thought leadership, trend-setting  
**Format:** Observation → Extrapolation → Implication → Action

```
[OBSERVATION]:
I've noticed [TREND or PATTERN] happening across [INDUSTRY/MARKET]

[EXTRAPOLATION]:
If this continues, [PREDICTION about where it leads]

[WHY IT MATTERS]:
This matters because [IMPACT for your audience]

[CONTRARIAN ANGLE] (Optional):
Most people think this trend means [COMMON INTERPRETATION]
But I think it actually signals [ALTERNATIVE VIEW]

[WHAT TO DO NOW]:
If you believe this trajectory, the smart move is [SPECIFIC ACTION]

[TIMELINE]:
I'd expect this to become standard within [TIMEFRAME]
```

**Example:**
```
I've noticed more SMBs are building "flexible team" models across 2024 — instead of hiring full-time, they're mixing contractors with part-time employees.

If this continues, the "traditional employment" model becomes a luxury most SMBs can't afford. Talent strategy = contractor management strategy.

This matters because the companies that build great contractor workflows TODAY will have huge competitive advantage tomorrow.

Most people think this trend means "everyone's going remote."
But I think it actually signals: The best talent is increasingly independent, and companies need to adapt their management approach.

If you believe this trajectory, the smart move is: Start building contractor evaluation and management systems NOW. The companies doing this in 2024 will have this dialed by 2025.

I'd expect this to become standard within 18 months.
```

## TEMPLATE 14: The Reader Question Response Post
**Best for:** Community engagement, social proof, value  
**Format:** Question → Direct answer → Broader insight

```
[QUESTION]:
A reader asked me: "[ACTUAL QUESTION from someone]"

[DIRECT ANSWER]:
The short answer is: [CONCISE RESPONSE]

[DETAILED EXPLANATION]:
But here's the nuance: [2-3 sentence explanation]
[Example or specific guidance]

[BROADER PRINCIPLE]:
This points to something bigger: [INSIGHT that applies beyond just this question]

[INVITATION]:
Have you thought about [RELATED QUESTION]?
If you're wrestling with something similar, hit reply — I'll answer what I can.
```

**Example:**
```
A reader asked me: "How do we know if a contractor is actually a good fit before hiring?"

The short answer is: Give them a small, paid trial project.

But here's the nuance: Most people use interviews to evaluate. But interviews are theater. You learn more from watching someone actually work than from their answers to hypothetical questions.
A 3–5 day paid trial for $500–1,000 costs way less than a bad full hire. And you see their real working style, communication, reliability.

This points to something bigger: Hiring is empirical, not intuitive. Test before committing.

Have you thought about what a good "test project" looks like for your specific work?
If you're wrestling with contractor evaluation, hit reply — I'll share a framework.
```

## TEMPLATE 15: The Milestone/Celebration Post
**Best for:** Community building, relatability, milestone sharing  
**Format:** Milestone → What it took → Lesson → Gratitude

```
[MILESTONE]:
[SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT - could be personal, company, reader story, etc.]

[WHAT IT TOOK]:
To get here, it required [KEY INGREDIENTS/EFFORT]

[LESSON]:
The thing I learned: [KEY INSIGHT]

[GRATITUDE]:
This wouldn't have happened without [WHO/WHAT - your audience, mentor, specific action]

[INVITATION]:
If you're working toward something similar, [ENCOURAGEMENT + SPECIFIC NEXT STEP]
```

**Example:**
```
We just helped our 100th client build a repeatable contractor hiring process.

To get here, it required us to stop treating each hiring situation as unique and start documenting what actually works.

The thing I learned: Scale comes from systems, not heroics. We spent months saying "this is customized for each client" — until we realized 85% of the work was the same intake questions, same evaluation framework, same onboarding template.

This wouldn't have happened without the contractors and clients willing to give us feedback on what worked and what didn't.

If you're working toward something similar, the next step is: Document what works. One client. One process. See what repeats.
```
